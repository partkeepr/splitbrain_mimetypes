This is a copy of the splitbrain.org mimetype icons, created by Andreas Gohr and others. It is intented to be used as git submodule.

Why?
---

There are some projects using the splitbrain.org mimetype icon set. Most developers simply put a copy of the icon set into their repository, wasting space. Using the icons as git submodule is more elegant and keeps your main repository pollution-free. As a bonus, you can fork and commit your own icons - and eventually merge them back.

The icon set is licensed under a public domain license.
